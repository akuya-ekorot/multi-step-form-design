## Overview

### The challenge

Users should be able to:

- [x] Complete each step of the sequence
- [x] Go back to a previous step to update their selections
- [x] See a summary of their selections on the final step and confirm their order
- [ ] View the optimal layout for the interface depending on their device's screen size
- [ ] See hover and focus states for all interactive elements on the page
- [ ] Receive form validation messages if:
  - [ ] A field has been missed
  - [ ] The email address is not formatted correctly
  - [ ] A step is submitted, but no selection has been made

## My process

### Built with

- [React](https://reactjs.org/) - JS library
- [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) - React framework
- [Tailwindcss](https://tailwindcss.com) - CSS utility framework
- [React Hook Form](https://react-hook-form.com) - Tiny library for forms
- Higher-order component to handle the steps
- State management by useReducer() and useContext()

### What I learned

- I really enjoyed diving deeper into useReducer and the reducer functions.
- I was able to carry some lessons from programming in C, specifically function pointers and implement that in conjuction with higher-order components and state. That was exciting to code.


### Continued development

- I'd like to continue work on accessibility and responsiveness. I feel like due to the limited time I had building this I didn't explore those areas very well.
